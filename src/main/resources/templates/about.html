    <h2>About our Store</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2025, we here at PC Parts Hub are committed to providing customers with top of the line PC parts at a value they can't find anywhere else. Cody got his start building computers at 16 first for himself, then friends and family, and eventually got hired at a computer shop. There he found a passion for working with people and helping them achieve what they wanted from their computer within a reasonable budget.</p>
    <p>We believe customers in any price range should be able to afford a reliable product without breaking the bank which is why we offer a variety of products catered to suit any budget. Whether you're in the market for a new GPU, looking to find all the parts needed for a complete build, or looking for a pre-built PC that ships ready to use we got you covered.</p>
